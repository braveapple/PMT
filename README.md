# Progressive Modality-shared Transformer (PMT) 
Pytorch code for paper "**Learning Progressive Modality-shared Transformers for Effective Visible-Infrared**

**Person Re-identifification**".

We adopt the ViT-Base/16 as the backbone. We also apply our proposed method on CNN-based backbone AGW [3].

|Datasets    | Backbone | Rank@1  | mAP |  mINP |  Model|
| --------   | -----    | -----  |  -----  | ----- |:----:|
| #SYSU-MM01 | ViT | ~ 67.53% | ~ 64.98% | ~51.86% |[GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PjQ9-WEq09ycgQLpSmRa6tYffZ4fdAhQ/view?usp=share_link)|
|#SYSU-MM01  | AGW* | ~ 67.09% | ~ 64.25% | ~50.89% | [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PjQ9-WEq09ycgQLpSmRa6tYffZ4fdAhQ/view?usp=share_link)|

*Both of these two datasets may have some fluctuation due to random spliting. AGW***** means AGW method with random erasing.  The results might be better by finetuning the hyper-parameters.
